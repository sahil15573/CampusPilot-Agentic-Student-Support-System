# 🧭 CampusPilot

**CampusPilot** is an AI-powered college assistant that answers student queries on academics, fees, and general topics using a **LangGraph-based conditional RAG pipeline**. It classifies each incoming query, routes it to the correct knowledge source (academic handbook or fee structure document), retrieves relevant context using FAISS similarity search, and generates a personalized response based on the student's programme (BCA / BBA / B.Com (H)). The project ships with a modern, dark-themed **Streamlit** frontend built to feel like a production-grade app rather than a typical prototype UI.

## 🔍 Overview

Most college FAQ bots either answer everything from a single knowledge base or rely on brittle keyword matching. CampusPilot instead uses an LLM-based **classifier node** to decide what type of question is being asked, then routes the query through a **LangGraph** conditional graph to the appropriate retrieval pipeline:

- **Academic queries** → retrieved from the academic handbook (attendance, exams, grading, credits, promotion, course structure, degree requirements)
- **Fee queries** → retrieved from the fee structure document (tuition, payment, refunds, late charges, scholarships)
- **General queries** → answered directly by the LLM without retrieval (greetings, casual conversation)

The final response is personalized based on the student's selected programme, so if a document contains figures for multiple programmes, the assistant highlights the one relevant to the student.

**State schema:**

```python
class State(TypedDict):
    programme: str                          # BCA / BBA / B.Com (H)
    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]  # conversation history
    query_type: str                          # academic / fee / general
    retrieved_context: str                   # retrieved chunks or "NO_RETRIEVAL_NEEDED"
```

## ⚙️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/CampusPilot.git
cd CampusPilot
```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Windows (PowerShell):
```bash
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

macOS / Linux:

## 🔑 Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Groq API key:

```
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

You can generate a free API key at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com).

> ⚠️ Never commit your `.env` file. It is already excluded via `.gitignore`.

---

## ▶️ Running the App

Make sure `academics_handbook.pdf` and `fee_structure.pdf` are present in the project root, then run:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

The app will open automatically at `http://localhost:8501`.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **User selects their programme** (BCA, BBA, or B.Com (H)) from the sidebar.
2. **User types a query** in the chat input.
3. The **classifier node** sends the query to the LLM, which returns one of three categories: `academic`, `fee`, or `general`.
4. Based on the category, the **conditional edge** routes the state to:
   - `academic_rag` → retrieves top 4 relevant chunks from the academic handbook FAISS index
   - `fee_rag` → retrieves top 4 relevant chunks from the fee structure FAISS index
   - `general` → skips retrieval entirely
5. The **response node** builds a final prompt (with or without retrieved context) and generates a personalized answer using the student's programme.
6. The answer, along with its classified category, is displayed in the chat UI with a colored tag chip for transparency into the routing decision.

## 💬 Example Queries

| Query | Routed To |
|---|---|
| "What is the minimum attendance required to sit for exams?" | Academic RAG |
| "When is the last date to pay semester fees?" | Fee RAG |
| "Is there a scholarship for meritorious students?" | Fee RAG |
| "How many credits are needed for promotion to next year?" | Academic RAG |
| "Hi, how are you?" | General |

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add persistent chat history storage (SQLite / Supabase)
- Support multi-turn conversational memory across sessions
- Add authentication so students see only their programme's data automatically
- Deploy on Streamlit Community Cloud or Render with cached FAISS indices
- Add source citation snippets (page numbers) alongside answers
- Support additional document types (timetables, exam schedules)
